# Sustainable Battery-Generator Hybrid (Virtual Prototype)

An R&D virtual prototype exploring a hybrid energy storage and generation system designed around eco-friendly, renewable input sources ‚Äî aiming to reduce waste, improve off-grid energy sustainability and attempt to produce at scale to decarbonise existing energy=intensive operations such as data-farming and crpto-mining.

---

## Overview

This project investigates a novel battery-generator hybrid device that:
- Stores electrical energy from **low-impact sources** (e.g., thermal, kinetic, or solar, wind).
- Can generate electricity on-demand using **a low-waste conversion mechanism**.
- Uses **recyclable or biodegradable materials** in its build to align with sustainable design principles.

---

## Prototype Goals

- Hybridize passive storage and active generation in a single compact unit
- Allow energy input from **non-conventional sources**
- Minimize environmental impact across lifecycle
- Validate feasibility through real-world bench testing
