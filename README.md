# Aerodynamic Objects for Wind Turbine Efficiency Simulation

## Overview

This Unity project aims to simulate non-linear atmospheric interactions using aerodynamic objects to enhance the efficiency of wind turbines. By accurately modelling the complex interactions between wind and turbine blades, this project seeks to provide insights into optimising turbine design and placement, ultimately contributing to more efficient renewable energy generation.

## Features

- **Realistic Wind Simulation**: Utilises advanced algorithms to simulate varying wind conditions, including turbulence and directional changes.
- **Aerodynamic Object Modelling**: Implements aerodynamic principles to create realistic representations of wind turbine blades and their interactions with the atmosphere.
- **Data Visualisation**: Provides visual feedback on wind flow patterns and turbine performance metrics, allowing for easy analysis and optimisation.
- **Customisable Parameters**: Users can adjust various simulation parameters, including wind speed, direction, and turbine specifications, to explore different scenarios.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks and displays key performance indicators such as power output, efficiency, and aerodynamic forces acting on the turbine.
